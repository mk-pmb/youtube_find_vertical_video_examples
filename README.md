====================================
<!--/#echo -->

<!--#echo json="package.json" key="description" -->
Find examples of horizontal (wider than high) and vertical videos (higher than
wide) on YouTube.
<!--/#echo -->


For sake of bureaucracy in
[a yt-dl feature request](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30737)
I had to provide actual examples of both groups of videos,
because made-up dummy data seemingly isn't good enough for testing.

Hopefully, this script will ensure that people can find lots of
example videos anytime they need them.
